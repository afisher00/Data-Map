<h2> Does it make a difference if NYPD officers are present for New Yorkers? </h2>


    <!--STORY GOES HERE-->

  <p> I was curious to find out: where exactly did NYPD officers live? You watch crime television, and it makes them appear to never leave the station. In real life, the volume of police presence has notably increased over the past few months, after increased reports on crimes in the subways. Officers are even riding the subway cars with New Yorkers now. Therefore, I wanted to see if there was a relationship between high police presence and crime rates. </p>

  <p>According to data obtained from the NYPD via a FOIL request, it broke up the number of police officers that reside in all New York counties, and the number of officers stationed to patrol in the five boroughs – broken up by the precincts. </p>

  <p> Since the 1960s, New York police officers have not been required to live in the same county in which they serve. However, recent debate about the topic has surfaced again with Mayor Adams stating that establishing more residency requirements for NYPD officers would be a “smart idea.” </p>

  <p> Currently, officers can live in the city itself or in one of the neighboring counties in New York: Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester.   </p>

  <p>Neighborhood Coordination Officer, Farooq Ahmed, patrols in police service area 3 in Brooklyn, and also resides in the borough. He expressed there being an advantage in living where you work. </p>

  <p> “You get to know the people and the community on a different level. Leading to you being able to kind of anticipate when something bad is about to happen.”

      According to NYPD crime data in 2015, violent crimes like murder and rape were down 3.8% while property crime such as burglary and larceny were down 12.4%. </p>

  <p> Staten Island indicated having the highest number of police officers residing in the borough while also serving in precincts there. However, Richmond county was amongst the highest counties to report violent and property crimes. </p>
